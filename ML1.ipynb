    "# OVERVIEW\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When speaking of the stock market, there are adages that may sound pithy but in practice often prove to be powerful and true. One of  most well known is “Don’t fight the Fed”, which argues that investors should respect the trend coming from the Federal Reserve decision making regarding monetary policy. Another that is less well known (if at all) is in regards to the power of a stock’s EPS trend, which is “Earnings trump and trend”.  This is an observation that often the best longer term stock investments are those where the investor is on the right side of the earnings trend. Both of these phrases speak to the power of trends in the stock market, of which the focus of this analysis will be on the latter of these two phrases, “Earnings trump and trend” and for which we hope the reader will come to a foundational place of understanding and conviction that such statement may in fact hold statistical power in its truthfulness, which we will embark to analyze and attempt to model with efficacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A few examples as detail / proof points of what we are talking about with this statement are as follows from companies most have heard of:\n",
    "#### •\tGoogle – During the past 5 years, GOOGL is up 279% with over 80% of this return coming from earnings per share (EPS) growth.\n",
    "#### •\tDomino’s Pizza – During the past 5 years, DPZ is up 228% with over 90% of this return coming from earnings per share (EPS) growth.  \n",
    "#### •\tHome Depot – During the past 5 years, HD is up 219% with approximately 70% of this return coming from earnings per share (EPS) growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Therefore, while getting the valuation “right” for a given stock is important, we would argue that getting the earnings “right” is even more important hence the “trump” notion. And accompanying this is the power of trends which Newton’s first law of motion would support the general power of trends which says, “an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force”.  We believe that such “momentum” is prevalent in the stock market and manifests itself in various ways, one of which is the operating performance / earnings trajectory of a given company.  This can be seen in earnings trends that ebb and flow over time as aspects such as industry dynamics, product cycles, etc. strengthen and weaken over various time periods.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### These foundational and experiential beliefs serve as the basis of the forthcoming analysis whereby we seek to use machine learning and related tools in order to analyze and model the earnings estimates of a basket of stocks, for which we will call this exercise EPS estimate revision momentum modelling.

    "#### The goal of this analysis is not only to use powerful algorithms to predict EPS but also better understand various drivers behind such predictions.  The chosen variables / data set had this goal in mind when being gathered and organized.  The use case for the analysis is multifaceted for both professional and individual investors.  For the professional, this analysis could serve to aid in the following:  predicting EPS which in turn could be used in combination with a target multiple and/or DCF in order to establish an estimated target price, predicting EPS and comparing growth potential across a universe of stocks, comparing the models outcomes with human driven modelling / analytical efforts, providing investment ideas based on the model’s output and providing insight into the various power of individual and groupings of metrics which can serve to guide the focus of an analyst’s research efforts to gain insight and dig deeper on additional metrics.  The use case could also be for individual investors as a means to generate investment buy and sell ideas based on the predictions made by the model.\n",

    "# DATA UNDERSTANDING\n",
    "\n",
    "#### To begin, let’s provide some background information on some “what’s” and “why’s” of our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are some of the reasons for using consensus earnings estimate data instead of historical or other measures?\n",
    "#### As discussed above, the premise of our analysis is to model the consensus EPS estimates.  We chose to model the consensus EPS estimates for several reasons:\n",
    "#### •\tWhile historical EPS is typically only reported on a quarterly basis, consensus EPS estimates are updated on a much more frequent basis thus gleaning insight from such daily movement as information enters the market is deemed valuable.\n",
    "#### •\tCrowdsource for insight…..don’t reinvent the wheel.  We are primarily approaching our analysis by studying those that know the subject (i.e. EPS trajectory) best and then seek to glean insight and improve upon it with powerful statistical calculations.  While we do have a few variables that are unrelated to consensus EPS estimates, the majority seek to capture changes in such metrics. We believe that embedded in their estimates is information from two parties which arguably know each company best and are trying to use statistics to validate such belief. One is the sell side analysts that cover a given stock and thus their livelihood depends on such skill and the other is company management which serves as the foundation of financial information being fed to such analysts and they too have their livelihood tied up in their respective company. Hence, we are not trying to outsmart them with other information but rather glean insight from them and use statistical tools to capture their collective wisdom in a manner which is statistical efficacious.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What basket of stocks did we choose and why?\n",
    "#### We narrowed down the universe of stocks for this analysis to 400 stocks.  We narrowed down the universe using Bloomberg and Factset based on the following parameters: \n",
    "#### •\tUS domiciled and traded companies\n",
    "#### •\tThe real estate sector was excluded due to the fact such stocks do not “trade” based on EPS (but rather funds from operations or FFO)\n",
    "#### •\tMarket cap greater than 1.5 billion.\n",
    "#### •\tWe set a floor on the number of analysts covering each stock as greater than 4 so that there is sufficient estimate data available for comparability purposes.\n",
    "#### •\tAt least 10 years of trading history, so that we can compute the desired metrics and compare accordingly.\n",
    "#### •\tFive year EPS growth must be above zero and the R-squared (historical EPS vs time) must be above 0.1, which further narrows down the universe to companies that are deemed higher quality and have had more stability with their historical EPS profile which we expect to aid in our ability to analyze and model such consensus EPS.  To further clarify, on the other side of the coin are companies with extremely volatile EPS profiles and at times are in the negative range which understandably would be much more difficult and less insightful to model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What was done to enable comparability across the basket of stocks given they are all unique businesses and grow at different rates?\n",
    "#### •\tWe normalized some of the variables in a way that ensured comparability (more details on this below).  Thus while some companies have grown faster than others we included both the absolute growth levels as well as relative / proportional levels.  Additionally, the analyst estimate figures are comparable across the universe thus needed no adjustments."

    "\n",
    "### We gathered weekly data during the past five years (12/30/16 - 12/30/21) and established six categories by which an explanatory variable is included in:  GROWTH, STABILITY, ANALYST REVISIONS, INCOME STATEMENT, RETURNS and OTHER.  In total there are 51 explanatory variables, 6 potential response variables and a total of ~104k rows of data.  Details on each category and the variables include are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### GROWTH\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Consensus (i.e. sell side analysts) EPS median estimates trends:\n",
    "\n",

    "#### •\tLabeled as “Best_EPS_##” in the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Percent relative to their respective 5 year growth rate for all the aforementioned time periods except the 5 year.  The 5 year growth rate approximates a company's longer term growth rate thus this ratio captures the current trend relative to the longer term.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### A continuous and classification variable seeking to capture short-term EPS acceleration, which is deemed attractive as the EPS is not only improving but in somewhat of a parabolic manner.  For the continuous variable we used the aforementioned EPS growth ranks (3M, 6M and 1Y), then averaged the three to get a continuous variable rank.  For the classification variable we segmented into those meeting (or not) the following criteria: EPS growth of 3M > 6M AND 6M > 1Y.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### See details above regarding crowdsourcing for the reasoning behind these revisions metrics.\n",
    "#### Sell side analyst EPS revisions (Upward, Downward and Unchanged).  A “revision” is a change (regardless of magnitude) in an analyst’s estimate during the past 3 months for a company’s EPS for the next 12 month period.  Calculated the % of total revisions for each metric.\n",
    "#### •\tLabeled as “An_Up\", \"An_Down\", \"An_Unch\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### We included the current value as well as the change in each of these variables on a 3- and 6-month basis and labeled them similarly to the previous metrics but added “_#M” on the end.  This captures second derivative changes in the revisions metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analyst revision ratios\t\n",
    "#### We pulled a predetermined metric labeled “Mark_Rev” from FactSet which seeks to quantify the relative trend in the analyst revisions with the lower being better.\n",
    "#### •\tLabeled as “An_Mark\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### We also created our own metric labeled as “Net_Est_Rev_Ratio” which equates to the following:  (Upward Revisions – Downward Revisions) / Total Revisions.  This ratio ranges from -100 to 100 and seeks to capture the change in such revision on a proportion basis during the past 3 month period.\n",
    "#### •\tLabeled as “NRR\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Both of these metrics were also used to create variables which capture the change in the Net_Est_Rev_Ratio and Mark_Rev on a 3- and 6-month basis, which similarly as above capture second derivative changes and labeled them similarly to the previous metrics but added “_#M” on the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### RETURNS\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Technical analysis presumes that price leads fundamentals as the collective market begins to price in changes in fundamentals prior to such changes becoming quantifiable.  As such, in hopes to capture some of the collective market’s wisdom based on the similar rationale above regarding analyst and management information capture, we included return data on a 1-, 3- and 6-month basis.\n",
