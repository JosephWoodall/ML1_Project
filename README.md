EPS ESTIMATE REVISION MOMENTUM MODELLING

OVERVIEW  
The basis of the forthcoming analysis is to use machine learning and related tools in order to analyze and model the earnings estimates from various angles / perspectives of a basket of stocks, for which we will call this exercise EPS estimate revision momentum modelling.

The goal of this analysis is not only to use powerful algorithms to predict EPS but also better understand various drivers behind such predictions. Additionally, we will be assessing the power of this dataset on predicting stock price performance. The chosen variables / data set had this goal in mind when being gathered and organized. The use case for the analysis is multifaceted for both professional and individual investors. For the professional, this analysis could serve to aid in the following: predicting EPS which in turn could be used in combination with a target multiple and/or DCF in order to establish an estimated target price, predicting EPS and comparing growth potential across a universe of stocks, comparing the models outcomes with human driven modelling / analytical efforts, providing investment ideas (buy or sell) based on the model’s output and providing insight into the various power of individual and groupings of metrics which can serve to guide the focus of an analyst’s research efforts to gain insight and dig deeper on additional metrics. The use case could also be for individual investors as a means to generate investment buy and sell ideas based on the predictions made by the model.
